## Project Overview

This study, conducted at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bangalore in 2014, aimed to develop a comprehensive plan for campus sustainability and enhanced sociability. The project focused on creating a sustainable campus environment characterized by wise resource utilization, minimized waste, and reduced operating costs, while simultaneously fostering a healthy and inspiring atmosphere.

A key aspect of the study was the design of desirable social spaces within the academic setting. Recognizing the potential of these spaces to promote student education, enhance student experiences, and facilitate social interaction, the study explored ways to create logical and authentic designs that encourage dialogue and the exchange of ideas. The goal was to create spaces that naturally bring students together, fostering real human interaction, discussions with professors, participation in campus events, and shared meals.
