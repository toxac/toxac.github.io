## Project Overview

This project is based on a UNESCO concept paper outlining the Indian Heritage Passport Program, with a specific focus on its implementation along the Hoysala Trail in Karnataka. The program addresses the challenges and opportunities of developing sustainable tourism in the region, emphasizing the need to move beyond popular sites and promote lesser-known heritage destinations.

The paper highlights the architectural and cultural identity of the Hoysala region and the importance of involving local communities in tourism development to ensure economic benefits and the preservation of cultural and natural heritage. The Indian Heritage Passport Program aims to market quality tourism destinations that prioritize the protection of local heritage, education of travelers, environmental concerns, and local employment. The document also proposes heritage itineraries around Belur and suggests investment opportunities in heritage accommodations and public-private partnerships.
