## Project Overview

This project involved the development of a web-based flood reporting platform for the Guwahati Municipal Corporation. The platform aimed to improve flood management by providing a tool for citizens to report flood instances in real-time.

Using geolocation technology, citizens could accurately pinpoint the location of flooding, providing valuable data for analysis and response. The platform served as a crucial tool for the municipal corporation and the Assam State Disaster Management Authority to understand the extent and impact of floods, enabling them to take timely action and provide relief to affected areas. The data collected was also used for long term analysis of flood patterns.
