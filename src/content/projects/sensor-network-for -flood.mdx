## Project Overview

This project involved the design and deployment of an Internet of Things (IoT) based sensor network in key water bodies across Guwahati. The primary objective was to measure water flow and levels in real-time, providing crucial data for flood monitoring and prediction.

The sensor network aimed to enhance the city's disaster preparedness by delivering timely and accurate information to the Guwahati Municipal Corporation and the Assam State Disaster Management Authority. This data facilitated informed decision-making for flood management and mitigation.
