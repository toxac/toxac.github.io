## Project Overview

In 2016, I designed and taught a course on Building Automation and Intelligent Spaces at SJB College of Architecture in Bangalore. The course aimed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and work with intelligent building systems.

The curriculum covered a wide range of topics, including:

* **Sensing the Built Environment:** Understanding how sensors can be used to monitor systems, people, and activities within buildings.
* **Data Analysis:** Learning how to process and interpret data collected from sensors.
* **Basics of Programming (Python):** Introducing students to Python programming for sensor integration and data manipulation.
* **Working with Sensors:** Gaining hands-on experience with various sensor technologies.
* **Data-Driven Building Design:** Exploring how sensor data can inform and improve architectural design.
* **Analyzing Spaces Through Sensor Data:** Using sensor data to evaluate and optimize the performance of built spaces.
