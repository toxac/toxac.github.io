## Project Overview

This project involved the creation of a comprehensive Site Management Plan for the Hoysala Heritage Region, commissioned by the Department of Tourism, Government of Karnataka. The plan aimed to ensure the sustainable conservation, tourism, and development of this culturally significant region. The Hoysala temples of Belur, Halebid, and Somanathapura, which are part of the Hoysala Heritage Region, were officially inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2023, recognizing their outstanding universal value and exceptional architectural and historical significance. The site management plan laid the foundation for the successful nomination and subsequent inscription.

The development of the plan involved participatory planning, urban development strategies, development control regulations, local economy analysis, socio-economic analysis, and tourism development strategies. The plan aimed to balance the needs of conservation, tourism, and local development, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Hoysala Heritage Region.
