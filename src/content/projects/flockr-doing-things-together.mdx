## Project Overview

Flockr is a mobile application currently under development, aimed at streamlining group planning and execution. It addresses the common frustration of managing multiple task lists across various apps and coordinating messages on platforms like WhatsApp. With Flockr, users can plan and organize group activities such as trips, grocery shopping, night outs, and shopping in a single, integrated platform.

By combining task management and messaging features, Flockr simplifies collaboration and ensures that everyone in the group is on the same page. The app is designed to enhance efficiency and make group activities more enjoyable.

**Note:** If you're interested in contributing to the development of Flockr, I'd love to collaborate! Please reach out to discuss potential involvement.
