## Project Overview

This project, conducted in 2010, focused on the digital preservation of the Tipu Summer Palaces in Bangalore and Srirangapatna. The core objective was to create innovative digital experiences that would engage tourists and provide new insights into these historical sites.

We developed detailed digital models of the palaces and created interactive interfaces and video narratives to showcase the architecture and history. A key focus was to highlight elements of the buildings that have been lost or deteriorated over time, bringing them back to life through digital reconstruction. The project aimed to provide a more immersive and educational experience for visitors, while also preserving these important cultural landmarks for future generations.
