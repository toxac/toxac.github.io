## Project Overview

This project centered on the development of Spice Studio, an automated processing system within GoodHarvest, designed to empower customers to create and share their own spice blends and multigrain flours. By providing precise ingredient percentages, users could formulate their own unique recipes, effectively participating in user-generated food creation.

The system not only processed these custom recipes but also facilitated a platform where users could showcase and sell their creations to the broader GoodHarvest community. A primary motivation behind Spice Studio was to preserve India's rich culinary heritage. With the rise of industrialized food, unique household spice blends and traditional recipes were rapidly being lost. This project aimed to provide a platform for individuals to maintain their culinary traditions and share them with others, fostering a dynamic marketplace of personalized and culturally significant food products.
