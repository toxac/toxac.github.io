## Project Overview

SUI-Enable was a venture I initiated to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical skills for architecture and planning students. Recognizing the need for hands-on training in emerging technologies, SUI-Enable offered courses focused on Data Analysis for Urban Development, Building Automation, and Geo Spatial Analysis.

In association with Sustainable Urbanism International, the venture provided students with real-world experience and practical knowledge, preparing them for careers in urban development and related fields. The training programs were designed to equip students with the tools and techniques necessary to address contemporary urban challenges. As a new business, SUI-Enable also involved significant efforts in business development and marketing to reach its target audience and establish a sustainable model.
