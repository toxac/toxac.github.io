## Project Overview

This project focused on creating a comprehensive heritage-based urban development framework and conducting feasibility studies for several culturally significant cities in Karnataka. The project aimed to leverage the rich historical and cultural heritage of these cities to promote sustainable urban development and economic growth.

The scope of work included a thorough economic and financial analysis to assess the viability of heritage development projects, analysis of tourism data and projections to understand future growth, and an evaluation of the existing infrastructure to identify areas for improvement. Market research was conducted to understand the demand for heritage tourism and related services. A detailed cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the economic and social benefits of heritage development initiatives. Finally, policy recommendations were developed to support heritage preservation and urban development. The cities covered in this project were Gulbarga, Bidar, Badami, Bijapur, Belur, Halebidu, Srirangapatna, and Mysore.
