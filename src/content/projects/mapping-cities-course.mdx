## Project Overview

In 2016, I taught a course titled "Mapping Cities" at SJB College of Architecture in Bangalore. This course aimed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how to use geographic information systems (GIS) and urban data to analyze and represent cities.

The curriculum began with the fundamentals of GIS, followed by an exploration of urban data, including its various sources and methods of collection. Students learned how to understand and analyze urban data, and then applied this knowledge to create data-driven maps. The course also covered the use of maps for both communication and analysis, emphasizing how maps can be used to convey information and support decision-making. Students were also given the opportunity to engage in practical projects, applying the skills and knowledge they gained throughout the course.
