## Project Overview

GoodHarvest was a venture I co-founded with Mithun SG in 2012, aiming to revolutionize the way consumers access and customize their food. We focused on delivering fresh produce and processed food items directly from farms to users, empowering them to personalize their food products.

We implemented automated processing systems, developed pioneering products, and managed stakeholder relationships, fostering partnerships within the agricultural and food processing sectors. An MVP was rapidly developed to validate the concept, utilizing user-centered design to enable users to create custom products like spice mixes and bundles for special needs. Community events and user testing were crucial for gathering insights. We also worked on standardizing the supply chain and processing methods, building strong relations with farmers and processors to ensure a sustainable and ethical supply network.
