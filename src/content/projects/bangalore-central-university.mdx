## Project Overview

In 2017, I contributed to the campus and programme development efforts at Bangalore Central University, which was established that year. My work focused on several key areas, including campus planning to create a conducive learning environment, curriculum design to meet student and industry needs, and strategies to enhance the university's industry interface.

In addition to these project contributions, I also served as a member of the Expert Committee for Campus Development, providing input and guidance on the university's overall development strategy.
